## Conway's Game of Life

### Project Description
Conway’s Game of Life is a cellular automated zero player game. The progression of the game is determined by the initial state, which is set by the user. All cells have two possible states, alive or dead. Visit the website to see the algorithm's rules and play (See status section for deployment link).

### Functionality
 - Random cell generation
 - Ablity to view one generation at a time
 - Adjustable speed
 - Abilty to select cells on grid for a custom cell pattern
 - Clickable presets that populate for the user
 - Modal that displays rules for user

### Status
- Deployment link: https://conway-game-of-life.dylan17th.vercel.app/
- The current repo and deployment of Conway's Game of Life is my final iteration and I will not be working on it anymore.

### Tech/Frameworks/libraries used
- React
- Javascript
- Vercel
- CSS

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
